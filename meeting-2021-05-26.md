May 26 17:38:10 <h4sh3d>        weekly meeting in 20 minutes
May 26 18:01:58 <TheCharlatan>  hello
May 26 18:03:47 <zkao>  hey
May 26 18:04:43 <h4sh3d>        hi
May 26 18:04:44 <lederstrumpf>  hi
May 26 18:06:28 <h4sh3d>        let's start with what was done during the past week
May 26 18:06:37 <h4sh3d>        I can go first
May 26 18:07:21 <h4sh3d>        I did some work on the RFCs, minor changes
May 26 18:07:45 <h4sh3d>        all related to the list of open issues
May 26 18:08:22 <h4sh3d>        did more research on taproot
May 26 18:08:45 <h4sh3d>        and we presented last Thursday the project at the Bitcoin meetup in Zurich
May 26 18:09:17 <h4sh3d>        the meetup was great, discussions too
May 26 18:09:57 <h4sh3d>        we talked about the 'free option' problem, and some potential solutions
May 26 18:10:15 <h4sh3d>        but none of them are complete and totally works
May 26 18:10:15 <zkao>  taproot is going to done sooner rather than later
May 26 18:10:27 <zkao>  what is the current estimate for activation?
May 26 18:10:51 <h4sh3d>        zkao: the last 'big' miners started to properly signal
May 26 18:11:03 <h4sh3d>        so next period should be >90%
May 26 18:11:27 <h4sh3d>        ~october or november... don't remember exactly
May 26 18:12:04 <h4sh3d>        current ratio is 97.16% from taproot.watch
May 26 18:12:05 <lederstrumpf>  if btc.com gets all their horses in the next few days, we should have lock-in in the next difficulty period
May 26 18:12:27 <zkao>  invisible swaps, there we go
May 26 18:12:41 <h4sh3d>        zkao: November for the activation
May 26 18:12:52 <lederstrumpf>  they just flaked on the last block again, so it seems not all their miners are signalling yet
May 26 18:14:22 <zkao>  so we started squatting #monero-swap in libera.chat
May 26 18:14:41 <zkao>  the matrix bridge is dropping messages in both directions
May 26 18:14:47 <TheCharlatan>  yes, I just registered my nick there as well.
May 26 18:16:06 <h4sh3d>        I think starting next week we may want to migrate on libera.chat
May 26 18:16:18 <zkao>  we have to write the montly report as well
May 26 18:16:53 <h4sh3d>        but other monero channels wait for tor support before migrating, so...
May 26 18:17:09 <zkao>  hmm, native tor support
May 26 18:17:22 <ComplyLast>    is there any tor support right now?
May 26 18:17:36 <h4sh3d>        'Libera.Chat is not yet accessible by Tor but we intend to have this available soon.'
May 26 18:17:41 <zkao>  fluffypony meant he will let people use his bouncer
May 26 18:17:52 <ComplyLast>    thanks h4sh3d
May 26 18:18:17 <zkao>  ComplyLast: thank you for sharing the paper
May 26 18:18:25 <ComplyLast>    yw
May 26 18:18:35 <zkao>  did u read it carefullly?
May 26 18:18:47 <h4sh3d>        given how messy it is now between matrix and freenode I don't know if we should wait
May 26 18:20:47 <ComplyLast>    zkao didn't have the time to read it as carefully as I wanted, glossed over it for now
May 26 18:21:29 <zkao>  ok, thx \n so things have been slow, and i expect them to stay slow for the next week, but then it should be back to normal
May 26 18:23:21 <zkao>  ComplyLast: we lost one of our team members, so there's room on the boat if u would like to participate on this workgroup actively
May 26 18:24:19 <ComplyLast>    I'll hang around but I don't have the right skill set to be of much help ^^
May 26 18:25:54 <zkao>  TheCharlatan:: any news on wallet development?
May 26 18:26:20 <lederstrumpf>  ComplyLast: I'll give it the paper a proper read by next week, then we can debate it properly ;)
May 26 18:27:53 <zkao>  i create a placeholder for the community update may
May 26 18:27:59 <zkao>  https://hackmd.io/9LbdrwmPTi2hDIjQgrCC-A
May 26 18:28:44 <TheCharlatan>  zkao: not really, I spent some time reading through farcaster-core, getting a sense of when and where we are currently signing in the protocol.
May 26 18:31:52 <h4sh3d>        TheCharlatan: the interface with the wallet is currently defined here https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-core/blob/main/core/src/crypto.rs#L230-L296
May 26 18:32:43 <h4sh3d>        and Alice/Bob struc in role.rs uses it
May 26 18:33:53 <h4sh3d>        all of this can evolve
May 26 18:34:57 <h4sh3d>        I want to publish on crates.io core and chains, this will provide documentation on docs.rs too
May 26 18:38:43 <zkao>  TheCharlatan: anything to say on the wallet api that is called Signatures?
May 26 18:39:24 <TheCharlatan>  I dont understand the question ^^
May 26 18:39:54 <zkao>  can u use trait Signatures in the wallet?
May 26 18:40:43 <TheCharlatan>  That is my current intention, yes.
May 26 18:44:29 <lederstrumpf>  I'm currently working on removing the child killer interface from farcasterd
May 26 18:44:34 <lederstrumpf>  https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/pull/38
May 26 18:44:59 <zkao>  good, i was sick of that infantocide
May 26 18:45:36 <lederstrumpf>  The reason it's there in the first place is that farcasterd's children (peerd etc.) would not get killed when I kill farcasterd in the context of a test.
May 26 18:46:14 <zkao>  i think it really is cool to get some manager of processes running
May 26 18:46:37 <lederstrumpf>  now, the first issue is that I was sending SIGKILL, which does not terminate gracefully
May 26 18:47:06 <lederstrumpf>  now I've switched to SIGINT (i.e. CTRL-C on the CLI), but it nonetheless does not kill the children too.
May 26 18:47:28 <zkao>  maybe try a different approach?
May 26 18:47:48 <zkao>  h4sh3d was mentioning some of the limitations on the testing in rust
May 26 18:47:51 <lederstrumpf>  I don't yet understand why this is the case, because now it should be equivalent to calling CTRL-C on the terminal
May 26 18:47:52 <zkao>  iirc
May 26 18:48:35 <lederstrumpf>  yeah, what I could do is use https://docs.rs/ctrlc/3.1.9/ctrlc/ to implement a handler that kills the children explicitly
May 26 18:49:06 <h4sh3d>        #[test] wraps the function into the cargo test environment, it's not a process like cargo run
May 26 18:49:09 <lederstrumpf>  but that would essentially be a wrapper around the current pedicide procedure
May 26 18:49:27 <zkao>  the thing is, if u were testing in bash, that would certainly work
May 26 18:49:49 <h4sh3d>        ^ old stuff always work ;)
May 26 18:50:13 <lederstrumpf>  h4sh3d: then maybe I'll try this outside of a test macro and see if the issue remains, thanks!
May 26 18:52:48 <lederstrumpf>  > i think it really is cool to get some manager of processes running
May 26 18:52:48 <lederstrumpf>  I was planning to remove that since its only purpose so far was to kill kids, but it would actually have utility for having farcasterd report which processes running on the systems belong to it (in particular for multiple farcasterd instances running).
May 26 18:53:29 <zkao>  it doesnt have that yet?
May 26 18:54:59 <zkao>  ah, u added it
May 26 18:55:12 <zkao>  i dont know actually
May 26 18:55:31 <zkao>  if that is needed
May 26 18:56:01 <lederstrumpf>  it's not needed for production, or at least for normal end-users
May 26 18:56:48 <zkao>  spawning_services is what is being used now
May 26 18:58:15 <zkao>  id doesnt follow the children specifically but the SeviceIds
May 26 18:59:53 <lederstrumpf>  ack - that does satisfy the same purpose, aside from terminating processes
May 26 19:00:18 <lederstrumpf>  in which case I'll remove all that code once it works without pedicide
May 26 19:02:12 <lederstrumpf>  h4sh3d: moving out of the test macro did not help, so that's not related
May 26 19:02:57 <zkao>  since this is just debugging, lets adjurn the official meeting
May 26 19:04:24 <h4sh3d>        hm, that was my first guess
May 26 19:04:48 <h4sh3d>        yes, I think we can adjourn here
May 26 19:04:54 <lederstrumpf>  ciao
May 26 19:05:00 <h4sh3d>        thanks everyone for joining
May 26 19:05:18 <h4sh3d>        we will communicate if we move/when we move to libera.chat
May 26 19:06:24 <zkao>  only 5 nicks in there, and 2 are ours
May 26 19:07:20 <zkao>  actually not true, 7 already, and 3 are ours
May 26 19:07:48 <zkao>  and moo is there
May 26 19:08:08 <zkao>  (going back to the initial discussion on tor)
