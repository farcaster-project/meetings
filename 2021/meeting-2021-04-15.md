**zkao**: h4sh3d: do u know when ur key branch is ready for review?

**h4sh3d**: just pushed it

**h4sh3d**: so I can start with that

**zkao**: meaning, its ready to review?

**h4sh3d**: first, it's based on https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-core/pull/24, so if this one is not ready then no

**h4sh3d**: second: yes it is in a good shape for now

**zkao**: the first one i reviewed already

**zkao**: so all good

**h4sh3d**: other changes are needed as the lib is still young but I think this one is big enough and self sufficient :)

**h4sh3d**: ok, then I can merge 24 and "rebase" so the diff is more clear, ok for you?

**zkao**: ok

**h4sh3d**: done

**h4sh3d**: this is how the API look like for now to create messages: https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-core/blob/cc8a04bf3f9b8cd251ec4f46f58e7085d604acc2/chains/tests/bundles.rs

**zkao**: ok, so i review and see how ugly it breaks the node

**zkao**: well reports say its already broken, so all good haha

**h4sh3d**: my guess is that it should not break the node too much

**zkao**: there is quite a bit of commented out stuff, maybe clean that up

**h4sh3d**: tl;dr of #29: it adds the concept of getting keys (pubkey and private view) for Arbittrating and Accordant chains based on a seed; it rewrite the implementation of datum messages; and it adds on Alice and Bob role (not finished) the creation of the bundles for each role (datum aggregate)

**h4sh3d**: yes I can do a cleanup commit

**h4sh3d**: do you know if you still need the Display impl on CommitAliceSessionParams protocol message

**h4sh3d**: ?

**zkao**: leave it in for now, please

**h4sh3d**: (it doesnt do anything)

**h4sh3d**: ok

**zkao**: (nothing = makes node compile)

**lederstrumpf**: so should the pr maybe be draft until datum aggregate creation is complete?

**zkao**: no, no

**zkao**: it has stuff that makes me move on

**zkao**: we have no users :)

**zkao**: we can break stuff

**lederstrumpf**: okok ^^

**zkao**: h4sh3d: thanks for the test, the api looks damn simple :)

**zkao**: for moving from puboffer into swap

**h4sh3d**: Cleanup done, last block of comments remaining I want to keep it as it's the next to impl

**zkao**: overall it looks really good, will play it around with it

**h4sh3d**: Core start getting in shape I think, there is stuff that is not pretty yet but most of the concept have been integrated

**h4sh3d**: meaning most of the complexity I want to have in core is there

**h4sh3d**: I want to publish core on crates.io "soon", so we can have access to the doc, that will help getting familiar with the lib too

**h4sh3d**: My next step now is finish the API for Alice and Bob roles (generating the bundles, and verify other's bundle for commitments)

**h4sh3d**: then see how I can migrate the crypto implementation from asmr into Core

**zkao**: flow the real sequence of messages, and then we progress in sync

**h4sh3d**: yes

**h4sh3d**: in parallel I also have to adapt some RFCs, for now I mostly opened issues to keep track of the changes needed

**lederstrumpf**: any updates to the datum RFC required?

**lederstrumpf**: I'm using it as reference to review the PR

**h4sh3d**: no, this should be in sync

**h4sh3d**: but RFC 10 is not correct anymore, the serialization changed for sized vector (before it was u8 len, now u16 len)

**lederstrumpf**: yup, saw that

**h4sh3d**: about RFC 10, the public offer does not contain a validity max time or something and I thing it should be good to allow future offer pruning of platforms or even in the node

**zkao**: by offer pruning u mean, offer expiring?

**h4sh3d**: yes

**lederstrumpf**: yes

**lederstrumpf**: these should expire within a few hours at most, I would say

**h4sh3d**: I'm thinking about a basic max age timestamp

**lederstrumpf**: and once lightning, femtoseconds ;)

**h4sh3d**: yes, always depends on the setup but you would probably not run the node with the same offers for days

**zkao**: it certainly should be in the offer, but anyhow, u can reject offers even if u just created it and its valid

**h4sh3d**: yes, this is more for UX/UI purposes, it does not change the real validity of an offer

**h4sh3d**: I opened an issue to track that

**h4sh3d**: lederstrumpf: IIRC the work you did about the M1 report is ready to be reviewed, right?

**lederstrumpf**: yes, let's quickly touch base on that

**lederstrumpf**: I wrote in Monero Community right after the March update saying it's ready for review and we'd appreciate some eyes on it before the next community meeting

**lederstrumpf**: I'm unsure when that meeting is, but it's been two weeks now, so maybe time to poke again

**h4sh3d**: agree, let's poke again and see if we can get any feedback

**lederstrumpf**: I'll ping on the channel

**h4sh3d**: it might actually be a good idea to poke of mrl too

**lederstrumpf**: yeah, mrl meeting should be starting now

**h4sh3d**: yes, let's adjourn here

**h4sh3d**: thanks all

**zkao**: im integrating changes in the node, i merge PR when integration is done, byt

**zkao**: bye

**lederstrumpf**: ciao
