**TheCharlatan**: hello :)

**kayabaNerve**: Morning

**lederstrumpf**: hey

**almutasim**: Hi.

**zkao**: hi

**lederstrumpf**: h4sh3d won't be joining us today, so we can just start now, I think

**zkao**: who has something to share from recent work?

**zkao**: or other topics to be discussed in today's meeting

**kayabaNerve**: I've been working on the syncer; I didn't submit my task work (small enough, anyways) to the main repo, so I upgraded that, and right now I'm working on task entry + cancellation. Basic enough stuff... then I'll be working on actually doing it for Bitcoin, as well as tests against a regnet.

**zkao**: cool, is the work public, can u share a link?

**kayabaNerve**: To my task definitions? Yes. To my current work on task entry? Not yet; haven't made a commit yet.

**zkao**: ok

**zkao**: did u have a look at the node, kayabaNerve?

**kayabaNerve**: https://github.com/kayabaNerve/farcaster-core, or more specifically https://github.com/kayabaNerve/farcaster-core/blob/main/core/src/tasks.rs, yet there's a few other files too. Finishing up event management in the syncer now.

**kayabaNerve**: I looked over the runtime you provided and realized I dislike using strict encoding :p

**zkao**: how could u not dislike it?

**zkao**: haha

**kayabaNerve**: I did appreciate that :) Yet I also had a question. You directly inlined the task queue (using stubs, ofc) into the runtime, which would make this unusable as a library. Given how lnp bp is somewhat monolithic, I want to ensure that no runtime actually has code in it. Do any of the other runtimes have this behavior?

**kayabaNerve**: To be clear, I'm calling it monolithic just due to the amount of libraries and practices it uses; I understand it's literally a suite of microservices with a common binding. That said, I am personally focus on the ingrained build avenue. It's the only one I see with widespread use, even if enterprises would prefer microservices.

**zkao**: nope, all of them are like the syncer

**zkao**: the node is not a library

**zkao**: why do u want it as a library?

**kayabaNerve**: I don't want the node as a library; I want a comprehensive library the node is a minimal skin on

**zkao**: but that is what it actually is now, in my opinion

**kayabaNerve**: Happy to hear it :) That was my question. I had only looked at the stub code in Syncer which was against that philosophy IMO

**kayabaNerve**: Tbc, I plan to make the runtime solely a socket manager.

**kayabaNerve**: If you want to grab the bitcoin_syncer file alone, and directly call its functions with values... no objection here. There's 0 serialization required, even internally.

**kayabaNerve**: *One Bitcoin object/up to two in theory do have addendums that are internally serialized as the generic code version wasn't working out.

**kayabaNerve**: For those I'm just using int to le bytes and back. Simplest possible algorithm.

**kayabaNerve**: Open to further discussion, of course, just something important to me. Want to make sure we're doing things right (not that I always know what that is; I don't put in nearly enough time to say that)

**kayabaNerve**: *And as one final note, yes, the proper task structure sent over sockets will use StrictEncoding.

**kayabaNerve**: It's the internal API I'm trying to avoid using any specific encoding in, other than the most minimal form.

**zkao**: swapd will send requests to syncer to watch a tx, for example

**zkao**: how would that work, on ur currently thinking?

**kayabaNerve**: It'll go through syncerd, I assume. That will provide the expected StrictEncoding usage and so on. That said, I aim for Syncerd to just be the SE/socket code, and the actual Syncer implementation to be ~20 lines as it'll just pass off to bitcoin_syncer, which can be imported by *anything*.

**zkao**: ok, say bitcoin_syncer is a crate from farcaster-core or something, and the syncer in the node itself, is a task manager or something

**zkao**: ?

**kayabaNerve**: I have it as a file under syncerd for now, but syncerd will end up solely being encoding/socket management. It will simply decode tasks from a socket and pass them off.

**zkao**: pass them off as in function call -- not as in RPC

**zkao**: ?

**kayabaNerve**: Yep

**kayabaNerve**: *Where we want to put bitcoin_syncer is another discussion. My vote would've been, when the time comes, we put all three components for BTC into their own crate. That said, the usage of lnp-bp does complicate things...

**kayabaNerve**: Because optimally, if I'm a third party building a DEX, I should be able to write my own communications layer, use the same encoding as I'm usually doing... yet still be able to grab the syncer to talk to a local BTC node for users to use in their copy of the app.

**zkao**: for monero-rs, we implemented strict_encoding in monero-rs

**kayabaNerve**: Which means not having a syncerd; just a syncer code file bundled into DEXd.

**kayabaNerve**: Good to know. I'm not saying none of bitcoin should use SE; even in its own crate, I expect lnp bp parts to be used as a dependency. Just commenting on my goal of making every part available as a library for use in a monolithic app, instead of just as microservices.

**kayabaNerve**: I personally want the microservices to be thin wrappers around the libraries, solely implementing sockets/network transmission protocols, and file management as needed (saving/loading swap state).

**zkao**: that is actually what it is

**zkao**: but still u have to handle all the requests

**zkao**: even if the request just give a socket addr back

**zkao**: anyway, enough of this, lets just keep in sync

**kayabaNerve**: zkao: Happy to hear it :) Sounds like we are on the same page.

**kayabaNerve**: Despite the long winded above :p

**kayabaNerve**: *I do understand that was the point of the design from the start

**zkao**: so i've been introducing the offer in the node, started from the client cli, to make and take offers

**zkao**: when u make a offer it binds an address and waits for connection

**zkao**: when u take it, it connects and start the swap

**zkao**: i'm still at the level of farcasterd, which means, im trying to start the swap, after its started, most of the work is at swapd spawned for that specific swap

**zkao**: farcasterd is the swaps managers, that is aware of all ongoing swaps

**zkao**: didnt get to swapd yet

**zkao**: hopefully by next week, im working only on swapd

**zkao**: almutasim, TheCharlatan lederstrumpf  -- anything to share?

**lederstrumpf**: I don't have anything to share this week

**TheCharlatan**: no, I tried building farcaster-node just now, but only got a bunch of strict encoding errors - will investigate and probably contact you zkao if I'm stuck.

**zkao**: maybe there are local paths on the node

**lederstrumpf**: > <@freenode_TheCharlatan:matrix.org> no, I tried building farcaster-node just now, but only got a bunch of strict encoding errors - will investigate and probably contact you zkao if I'm stuck.

it compiles for me on stable

**kayabaNerve**: with warnings, yet not with errors for me

**zkao**: lots of warnings :D

**kayabaNerve**: we should fix those :p

**kayabaNerve**: yet not errors

**kayabaNerve**: therefore technically acceptable

**zkao**: the warnings come from the cleaning up, but it has to be cleaned up further

**zkao**: lots of unused stuff

**TheCharlatan**: ok, building for me as well :P

**almutasim**: We at Monero Outreach are working on an article covering atomic swaps. h4sh3d has kindly offered to make a second review on Friday. I'm hoping it will be finalized and go out next week.

**zkao**: hmm, hes AFK these days

**zkao**: but if he said friday, he will probably do it

**zkao**: did u sort out the confusion of HTLC and PTLC?

**almutasim**: He said in an e-mail he would be able to look at it then. His taking the time is much appreciated.

**TheCharlatan**: almutasim are you working on this publicly?

**zkao**: its really appreciated that you're writting an article focused on farcaster!

**almutasim**: Yes, HTLC is used descriptively now. I'm not familiar with PTLC.

**zkao**: H is for Hash

**zkao**: P is for Point as in eliptic curve point

**almutasim**: > <@freenode_TheCharlatan:matrix.org> almutasim are you working on this publicly?

Yes, we work in public at https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations/us/293.

**TheCharlatan**: cool!

**almutasim**: Thanks! The goal is to make something accessible but informative.

**almutasim**: After it is finalized, it will be formatted for the Monero Outreach website, https://www.monerooutreach.org/.

**zkao**: cool guys, i guess we close the meeting now, feel free to continue discussions

**almutasim**: Thanks!

**lederstrumpf**: cheers
