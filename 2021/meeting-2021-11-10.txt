Nov 10 13:45:15 <h4sh3d>	Meeting in 15 min
Nov 10 14:03:10 <h4sh3d>	I'm preparing an offer from a fresh VM, who wants to take it :)
Nov 10 14:15:19 <h4sh3d>	waiting for someone: 46435357415001000200000080800000800800460500000000000008001027000000000000040004000000040005000000010800010000000000000001210003120104a0f893d395909116e06090fcbff0951f8af0ddcdd02e5b13f958e39a0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009f64f20e260700
Nov 10 14:16:39 <h4sh3d>	(node build against current main)
Nov 10 14:34:26 <lederstrumpf[m]>	taken - chuck yer XMR! :P
Nov 10 14:36:16 <h4sh3d>	error on peerd on my side
Nov 10 14:36:13 <lederstrumpf[m]>	ah, interesting
Nov 10 14:37:35 <h4sh3d>	let's restart: 46435357415001000200000080800000800800460500000000000008001027000000000000040004000000040005000000010800010000000000000001210003120104a0f893d395909116e06090fcbff0951f8af0ddcdd02e5b13f958e39a0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009f64f20e260700
Nov 10 14:39:01 <h4sh3d>	Unrecoverable peer error Peer interface error: I/O socket error, generated by underlying socket implementation (POSIX or TCP). Error type is UnexpectedEof
Nov 10 14:38:19 <lederstrumpf[m]>	I first took offer but with a reused wallet, then killed it and retook - no suggestion of failure on my side on the second round, but it obviously failed when my first peer disconnected
Nov 10 14:39:13 <lederstrumpf[m]>	h4sh3d: ok, again on my side: I accidentally retook the first offer, and your client apparently accepted it?
Nov 10 14:39:18 <lederstrumpf[m]>	let's restart
Nov 10 14:41:21 <h4sh3d>	oh, ok. lemme restart the daemon
Nov 10 14:41:43 <h4sh3d>	offer: 46435357415001000200000080800000800800460500000000000008001027000000000000040004000000040005000000010800010000000000000001210003120104a0f893d395909116e06090fcbff0951f8af0ddcdd02e5b13f958e39a0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009f64f20e260700
Nov 10 14:41:52 <h4sh3d>	(should be always the same offer by the way)
Nov 10 14:43:14 <h4sh3d>	look good now
Nov 10 14:43:32 <h4sh3d>	i'm using blockstream electrs, so IIRC should fail on my side at some point
Nov 10 14:45:49 <lederstrumpf[m]>	any `query_transactions` call should fail since blockstream electrs doesn't support ElectrumX, so no `transaction_get_verbose` support.
Nov 10 14:47:33 <h4sh3d>	what is weird is that I have no warn...
Nov 10 14:47:43 <h4sh3d>	they were there before
Nov 10 14:47:04 <lederstrumpf[m]>	i.e. we should be done now, since you can't see my `Lock` tx `f9abc8e8b6f88e81afa0f07717063ab91e270418f8cdda9cb0aaa6350fde90d7` ;)
Nov 10 14:48:36 <h4sh3d>	alright, lets stop then
Nov 10 14:48:53 <h4sh3d>	lemme configure the daemon with a proper electrs
Nov 10 14:48:30 <lederstrumpf[m]>	üëçÔ∏è
Nov 10 14:53:41 <h4sh3d>	let see now :)
Nov 10 14:53:42 <h4sh3d>	46435357415001000200000080800000800800460500000000000008001027000000000000040004000000040005000000010800010000000000000001210003120104a0f893d395909116e06090fcbff0951f8af0ddcdd02e5b13f958e39a0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009f64f20e260700
Nov 10 14:57:41 <h4sh3d>	electrs connection not working
Nov 10 14:57:45 <h4sh3d>	wait
Nov 10 15:01:38 <h4sh3d>	here we go again, I'm an illiterate dumbass
Nov 10 15:01:42 <h4sh3d>	46435357415001000200000080800000800800460500000000000008001027000000000000040004000000040005000000010800010000000000000001210003120104a0f893d395909116e06090fcbff0951f8af0ddcdd02e5b13f958e39a0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009f64f20e260700
Nov 10 15:01:55 <h4sh3d>	not able to spell an address correctly
Nov 10 15:04:42 <h4sh3d>	hmmm, now the monero wallet rpc doesn't work
Nov 10 15:05:09 <h4sh3d>	it really emphasis the need of a easily replicable stack
Nov 10 15:05:14 <h4sh3d>	let me debug that
Nov 10 15:06:23 <h4sh3d>	forgot to forward some docker ports... :(
Nov 10 15:08:53 <h4sh3d>	try again (same offer)
Nov 10 15:12:23 <h4sh3d>	bitcoin received in tb1qpyw4s0z56jhtfuz9eefgh8w90u3f8jlkyhvyqv
Nov 10 15:13:19 <h4sh3d>	now everything is going to fast (0 conf) but I have a PR on node to set btc to 2 blocks and xmr to 6
Nov 10 15:14:06 <h4sh3d>	let's try to do another one on top of this one, just for fun
Nov 10 15:14:16 <h4sh3d>	I'll change the amounts exchanged a bit
Nov 10 15:15:03 <h4sh3d>	464353574150010002000000808000008008002e090000000000000800204e000000000000040004000000040005000000010800010000000000000001210003120104a0f893d395909116e06090fcbff0951f8af0ddcdd02e5b13f958e39a0e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009f64f20e260700
Nov 10 15:17:13 <lederstrumpf[m]>	I missed the changed amount, but sent a second tx
Nov 10 15:18:54 <h4sh3d>	did you restarted your farcasterd?
Nov 10 15:19:44 <h4sh3d>	the offer is not taken on my sid
Nov 10 15:19:48 <h4sh3d>	*side
Nov 10 15:25:29 <h4sh3d>	alright, thanks for testing with me. Will move on coding a bit now
Nov 10 15:35:17 <lederstrumpf[m]>	no, I had not restarted the farcasterd inbetween
Nov 10 15:35:50 <lederstrumpf[m]>	> the offer is not taken on my side
Nov 10 15:35:50 <lederstrumpf[m]>	it established the connection on my side.
Nov 10 15:37:38 <h4sh3d>	hm, I think we will have to debug for making multiple swap at the same time, but should not be complicated
Nov 10 16:43:11 <Inge>	keep up the good work <3
Nov 10 16:45:32 <h4sh3d>	thanks for the support :)
