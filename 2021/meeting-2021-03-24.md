**h4sh3d[m]**: Hello

**lederstrumpf**: hi

**h4sh3d[m]**: ping TheCharlatan kayabaNerve lederstrumpf zkao and all others that want to join ;)

**almutasim[m]**: Hi

**TheCharlatan**: hello

**zkao**: hi

**kayabaNerve**: Hi

**h4sh3d[m]**: Alright, let's start

**kayabaNerve**: Was just about to ask where should we :P

**h4sh3d[m]**: ;)

**h4sh3d[m]**: I propose we do a round table on what we have been doing, I let you guys go first

**zkao**: kayabaNerve: can u force push to ur old PR or link the commitment building thing on monero-rs, cant find them

**kayabaNerve**: zkao: Yeah, have yet to push it; asked you how I should :P WIll do that after my next message

**kayabaNerve**: I recently defined the Syncer Tasks/the Syncer itself, which has a lot to discuss. I added enum_dispatch to the codebase as I wanted to use traits for the extendable Tasks (WatchAddress, which differs by coin). This would allow storing the trait forms in an enum. It should be removable now, as I ended up with an addendum: T, where T is a struct of things like the spend/view key. The reason it's a struct is so the Syncer can

**kayabaNerve**: implement any encoding over it. That said, it possibly should be a Vec<u8>, giving full control of encoding to the developer of that instance, and removing the generic.

**zkao**: so if u go to https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/tree/main/src u will see the daemons the node has ending with d

**kayabaNerve**: I also implemented a basic Syncer transport which just directly calls the functions on the larger Syncer traits (Client/Server, sendTask/sendEvent/recvEvent), that will probably be deleted/moved to a different part of the codebase. Still wrapping my head around layout, notably with farcaster-node

**zkao**: kayabaNerve: the concrete syncers should probably end up there

**kayabaNerve**: Yep.

**kayabaNerve**: Thanks :)

**zkao**: farcasterd is the swap manager, that is used to initiate the swap

**zkao**: peerd handles peer connections

**zkao**: swapd handles the swap itself

**kayabaNerve**: Thanks for the heads up :D

**zkao**: i could build the skeleton syncer there if u wish

**zkao**: then u take over

**kayabaNerve**: That'd actually be quite helpful if it wouldn't take too much of your time. Else, I can figure it out

**kayabaNerve**: zkao: https://github.com/kayabaNerve/monero-rs/commit/caed7e9002d8a9533bac8fd7bcd9d5825e1f3d7c

**kayabaNerve**: It's https://web.getmonero.org/library/Zero-to-Monero-2-0-0.pdf 5.3

**kayabaNerve**: \*It does still need tests

**h4sh3d[m]**: I worked a bit on the negotiation and the public offer

**h4sh3d[m]**: I drafted a RFCs about the offer: https://github.com/h4sh3d/RFCs/blob/rfc-10/10-public-offer.md

**h4sh3d[m]**: and started the implementation: https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-core/pull/14

**h4sh3d[m]**: I have some work to do/clean up before this get merged, but as now there is the possibility to create and serialize/parse a public offer, which contains all the data (without the peer connection) needed to bootstrap a swap

**h4sh3d[m]**: The only current limitation is when you deserialize you have to give the types, e.g. `PublicOffer<Bitcoin, Monero>`

**zkao**: h4sh3d: can u add a test for amount recovery?

**h4sh3d[m]**: zkao: I'm already on it, will be done this evening

**h4sh3d[m]**: I found the transaction where we have the key and a valid output of 0.007000000000 xmr in it

**h4sh3d[m]**: in the existing tests (for output discovery)

**h4sh3d[m]**: we will use the crate `strict_encoding` for managing serde between the components and between the peers

**h4sh3d[m]**: zkao: can you do a PR on monero-rs that adds a feature for implementing the MoneroConsensus strategy and strict_encoding on the types

**zkao**: i started on it, but realize we need another crate as well, amplify

**h4sh3d[m]**: [tests/recover_outputs.rs:47] tx.get_amount(&view_pair, &out) = Ok(

**h4sh3d[m]**:     7000000000,

**h4sh3d[m]**: )

**h4sh3d[m]**: it works :)

**h4sh3d[m]**: what the problem with the amplify crate?

**zkao**: i think it makes sense to use it for an external crate implementing strict_encoding for foreign types

**-->**: raecarruth (~0@gateway/tor-sasl/raecarruth) has joined #monero-swap

**zkao**: because its more like a hack

**zkao**: but if its native, it seems less sensible

**zkao**: otherwise u have to impl Strategy for everything u want to be strict encoded

**zkao**: why not impl StrictEncode directly then

**h4sh3d[m]**: because Strategy is simpler as it takes only the MoneroConsensus strategy who implements it for everything

**zkao**: no, it doesnt work like that

**h4sh3d[m]**: it's not a hack, it's intended to be like that

*****: zkao < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/iUPZQzOEqooGoAItNuJKySXF/message.txt >

**zkao**: sorry, it cropped

**zkao**: but i have to impl strategy for every element that is needed

**zkao**: impl Strategy for PrivateKey {

**zkao**: impl Strategy for PublicKey {

**zkao**: (btw, i prefer secret over private)

**zkao**: sk vs pk is used widely

**lederstrumpf**: > i think it makes sense to use it for an external crate implementing strict_encoding for foreign types

**lederstrumpf**: `amplify` looks like it wants to grow into the equivalent of c++'s `boost` for the rust world ^^

**h4sh3d[m]**: yes, impl Strategy for every types we want to strict encode and decode. what's the problem with that?

**zkao**: why Strategy vs Strict Encoding directly and cut down on dependencies?

**h4sh3d[m]**: Oh, I see, Strategy is in amplify, not strict_encoding

**h4sh3d[m]**: sorry miss that

**h4sh3d[m]**: then why touching monero-rs right, we can use strategy in farcaster-core/chains when implementing

**h4sh3d[m]**: ok, feel free to poke me if needed. Would be happy to help

**lederstrumpf**: let's quickly jump on the M1 report

**-->**: da47c2[m] (da47c2matr@gateway/shell/matrix.org/x-mqirixcnmijuafhs) has joined #monero-swap

**lederstrumpf**: we've ticked off everything now, I think

**lederstrumpf**: well, almost: still need to specify `RecKey` in RFC7

**lederstrumpf**: but everything else is complete to the end

**lederstrumpf**: `M1.A.2` is superseded by `M1.B.1` and `M1.C`

**lederstrumpf**: during the #monero-community meeting on Saturday, I posted a draft of the delivery document asking for feedback on the structure.

**lederstrumpf**: iirc, they plan to meet again this Saturday, so I think we inform them of the completion of M1 on Friday (after a last review) and then raise it again in the meeting.

**h4sh3d[m]**: I'll work on `RecKey`, it's not in RFC7 because the function itself is a bit weird. It's not needed, it was introduce in the One-time VES to make the APIs consistent, it just copies values from key/sigs. will fix that in the RFC and make it clear

**lederstrumpf**: cool, then all good

**lederstrumpf**: I might still do the enhancement of linking user stories to the client<->daemon messages too, but it's not required for the delivery - just think it's useful for an overview in general.

**h4sh3d[m]**: The two non-draft PR should be merged now, can you do it too?

**lederstrumpf**: yes
