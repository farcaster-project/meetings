**zkao**: hey

**TheCharlatan**: hello :)

**h4sh3d**: Hi

**h4sh3d**: let's wait a bit more to let people join if they want and then we start the meeting

**lederstrumpf**: hello

**h4sh3d**: ping kayabaNerve

**h4sh3d**: ok, let's start

**h4sh3d**: we can share what we have done the last week first

**h4sh3d**: I did work on the dependencies mostly

**h4sh3d**: principally inside monero-rs/monero-rs repo

**h4sh3d**: as stated in our last community update a new version got released: 0.12.0

**h4sh3d**: https://github.com/monero-rs/monero-rs/releases/tag/v0.12.0

**zkao**: cool, i worked mostly on swapd and farcasterd

**zkao**: i completed the wiring for the buy path

**zkao**: but i left most of the functionallity at farcasterd so far

**zkao**: swapd is just routing mostly

**zkao**: i started working a bit on peerd as well

**zkao**: as the PR i made upstream to internet2 got merged

**TheCharlatan**: nice

m.reaction

**TheCharlatan**: but still needs to be released, did he indicate when?

**zkao**: i wouldnt expect it to rush

**zkao**: i have to try to use it, and see what i have to do on the dependencies that use the same library

**zkao**: its gonna be a mess, but i expect to take too long till it gets released and included on the other deps

**h4sh3d**: do you think you can help on these dependencies and PR them as well?

**zkao**: yes, i hope so

**zkao**: we have to do for ourselves anyway

**lederstrumpf**: I worked on integration tests on farcaster-node - I opened two compounding PRs over here - they're ready for review now:
https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/pull/27
https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/pull/29

**lederstrumpf**: The issue I was facing is that within tests, child processes wouldn't terminate when their parent dies, so they have to be killed manually.

**lederstrumpf**: So there's a new control message (`Pedicide`) for doing this.

**zkao**: when i kill farcasterd, its children gets killed as well

**zkao**: outside of ur tests

**lederstrumpf**: Since it works outside of tests, I'll exclude these with a compiler flag from the normal build process.

**h4sh3d**: maybe there is a flag we can pass to `cargo test` to tell how to manage processes, but this behavior may be required by rust test framework

**h4sh3d**: setting only one thread may change this behavior (but I doubt), with ` -- --test-threads=1`

**lederstrumpf**: nope, reducing test-threads doesn't kill children

**zkao**: ok, i completed integration of ur open pr in the node, so i can will review it further and merge

**zkao**: h4sh3d:

**zkao**: open pr in core, i use as dep on the node, and it works

**zkao**: using the  Wallet struct

**h4sh3d**: this one: https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-core/pull/50

**h4sh3d**: yes, great

**h4sh3d**: after this gets merge I'll work on the encoding and protocol message lighting encoding

**h4sh3d**: this will improve how -chains can implement -core and reduce wrappers around `Amount`, `Address`, etc

**h4sh3d**: I'm going to work on RFCs next week, we can now do another iteration to improve them based on the implementation

**h4sh3d**: they still stand valid and nothing stated in the RFCs was not implementable, but we can generalized on some point

**zkao**: but the rfcs should reflect more the constraits, rather than our implementation

**h4sh3d**: the best example I have is the Monero private view key, which is specific to Monero and Bitcoin<>Monero swaps

**zkao**: contraints*

**h4sh3d**: yes, sure. this will not change

**TheCharlatan**: I started review on your PR(s) lederstrumpf

**h4sh3d**: the other example I can give is the RFC 10, there is a list of issue open that can be addressed now

**TheCharlatan**: Besides I've been working on my walletd, nothing to report yet though.

**zkao**: yes, if u look at my latest commits, you will see that farcasterd is really a wallet

**zkao**: so i guess farcasterd would launch a swapd(swapd) and a walletd(swapid)

**zkao**: and they would run the protocol without involving farcasterd too much, something like this, right?

**h4sh3d**: as farcasterd is the orchestrator yes, I think it's good

**h4sh3d**: do you envision one walletd for all swaps, or one per swap?

m.reaction

**zkao**: it would be one per swap, i guess

**h4sh3d**: (I'd guess one for all, but I think we can argue)

**zkao**: ok, but then farcasterd doesnt launch it

**zkao**: right now the functionality that is going through swapd and farcasterd is the daemon - client communication from the rfcs

**lederstrumpf**: well, farcasterd can still launch it, but only for the first swap in its queue, and then later swapd instances use the same?

**zkao**: so i dont know the name, but who doest this communication?

**zkao**: its between swapd and something else, what something else?

**zkao**: now its farcasterd

**zkao**: so the farcasterd keeps track of one wallet per swapd

**lederstrumpf**: right, but `farcasterd` could also keep track of a single wallet that all `swapd`s use

**lederstrumpf**: not saying that I prefer this approach, but I don't see the architectural constraint to do it this way

**zkao**: but then the wallet has to be able to do derivations

**zkao**: for each swap_id

**lederstrumpf**: yes

**zkao**: h4sh3d: are you up to doing that?

**TheCharlatan**: lederstrumpf how are you running your integration tests at the moment? Just `cargo test`?

**lederstrumpf**: which I think is more overhead than having a unique `walletd` for every `swapd`

**lederstrumpf**: TheCharlatan: `cargo test --features integration_test -- --show-output`

**zkao**: but what is the difference between walletd and farcasterd?

**zkao**: who is doing the chat with swapd, this is what interests me

**zkao**: ?

**h4sh3d**: I'm not sure what is the best, but the first question for me is: how our choices on that topic makes it flexible for interacting with hardware devices latter, with multiple concurrent swaps

**zkao**: the issue with hardware devices is that u have to impletment adaptor sig etc in the device

**h4sh3d**: yes, I know. it's far fetched

**zkao**: so we push it to the edge as much as we can, and not more

**h4sh3d**: exactly

**h4sh3d**: swapd asked all its cryptographic needs to walletd, the rest to farcasterd, that's how I see it

**h4sh3d**: *asks

**zkao**: because right now farcassterd knows about all swaps

**zkao**: then farcasterd and walletd will know about all the swaps

**h4sh3d**: walletd is started before swapd (both by farcasterd) and passed in parameter to swapd

**h4sh3d**: this would not change: farcasted nows all swaps, swapd one swap, walletd does not care

**zkao**: for me conceptually, either walletd is one per swap, even if that is just the signer, or farcasterd does the job of wallet

**h4sh3d**: then walletd is one per swap, it makes sense

**zkao**: i dont like two swap managers in the block

**lederstrumpf**: intuitively, I prefer the first route

**h4sh3d**: we can see it as a "backend client" or a "daemon client"

**h4sh3d**: and there is one client per swap

**h4sh3d**: ok, great. Anything else to share for the next week?

**zkao**: TheCharlatan: how is ur view on walletd?

**zkao**: can u open a draft pr to see what u r envisioning?

**TheCharlatan**: yes, opening draft is my intention, but I'm not there yet.

**zkao**: what are the functions of walletd?

**zkao**: that u r envisioning?

**TheCharlatan**: I agree with the functionality that h4sh3d laid out.

**zkao**: but does it chat with swapd ?

**TheCharlatan**: Yes, I think that makes the most sense. The less orchestration the better.

**zkao**: https://is.gd/xGox4f

**zkao**: what im asking whos is daemon and whos is client on this diagram

**zkao**: daemon is swapd, but client its not too obvious

**zkao**: there all this communication btw client and daemon

**h4sh3d**: client become walletd IMO

**h4sh3d**: and yes they talked to each other, walletd and swapd

**h4sh3d**: *talk

**TheCharlatan**: with a 1:1 relationship.

**zkao**: for me that is not that the wallet has to be ready and responsive at all times

**zkao**: sorry, i meant, wallet has to be ready to sign, but here it has to remain online

**zkao**: or not, if we sign everything and give it to swapd

**zkao**: still, we need to be back online later, but thats fine

**TheCharlatan**: yeah, I think pre-signing is the intention, right?

**zkao**: either way should work

**h4sh3d**: as much as possible, but yes if walletd is the 'client' then it must be online at some critical point

**h4sh3d**: pre-siging is possible but not everything at once, there should be 2 or 3 batch of pre-signing depending on the swap role you act has

**h4sh3d**: IIRC

**zkao**: right now its totally interactive, so certainly no presigning

**zkao**: things happen only at the last moment

**zkao**: as i said, swapd is used mostly for routing btw farcasterd and swapd

**lederstrumpf**: the critical question for me wrt. presigning is where the interface to external client wallet sits: in walletd or farcasterd.

**lederstrumpf**: for the funding txs

**zkao**: actually, what about all the communication remains with farcasterd, but farcasterd uses walletd to sign

**zkao**: ?

**lederstrumpf**: I think it makes most sense to have this happen in walletd too - just means that the user's client speaks with both farcasterd and the walletd

**lederstrumpf**: but then the walletd will have to authenticate itself to the user

**TheCharlatan**: I find this discussion very hard to follow, even now on its third read-through.

**lederstrumpf**: maybe we cut off here and revisit next week?

**TheCharlatan**: You are using 'user's client' here again lederstrumpf, what do you mean with 'client'? The cli?

**zkao**: the issue is: if there is only 1 walletd, it should be linked to one farcasterd

**lederstrumpf**: yes, cli and eventually other clients too

**zkao**: farcasterd already does start all the swaps, and talks to swapd

**zkao**: im not sure walletd as well has to talk to swapd, i think it can talk to farcasterd and farcasterd  talks to walletd when it needs to

**h4sh3d**: I think we should continue this discussion, but for now is there anything else we want to share before adjourning the meeting?

**lederstrumpf**: doesn't seem so, so we can continue discussing :P

**h4sh3d**: ok, let's adjourn here then; lederstrumpf you publish the logs right?

**h4sh3d**: thanks everyone for joining today
