**zkao**: hey, meeting today starting in 40 min

**zkao**: i started writting the community update, and i'm afraid it will be too controversial, so suggestions/recommendations would be welcome: https://hackmd.io/8KYUr_NNSIi7oEuw5L4hGA?view

**gingeropolous**: CCC event?

**gingeropolous**: im not so l33t

**gingeropolous**: my off the cuff opinion - as long as staying close to lightning network stuff doesn't introduce silly complications, i don't see it as problematic.

**zkao**: computer chaos conference, CCC, C3

**gingeropolous**: afaiu, bitcoin *needs* lightning to survive, so its going to work at some point. sounds like a good train to hop on

**LyzaL**: lightning is weird. Like oh hey, our coin needs on chain demand to create a fee market, but wait, now transactions or to expensive, so we'll make this second layer, to reduce on chain demand....

**LyzaL**: so Idk, not convinced it's going to work out, but yeah, seems they're gonna try to force it so ginger still has a point :)

**gingeropolous**: well thrive i guess is the better term

**kayabaNerve**: I'd argue it's technical and not relvevant to the end user given the final summary + how long its length was. That said, a section on it is important to have for record keeping and transparency.

**kayabaNerve**: Not exactly helpful, I know. If the disclaimer was moved up to clarify our intent, that'd help quickly define we're not requiring usage of lightning BTC

**kayabaNerve**: Which would reduce the amount of people complaing and clarify this is beneficial tech, not different tech.

**zkao**: feel free to fix it

**lederstrumpf**: hey all, let's start the meeting for today

**zkao**: gingeropolous: the idea was to drop compatibility on parts that silly complications appear

**zkao**: LyzaL:  the point for us, is not whether the "lightning network" survives, its more about inheriting some of its standards that might be useful to us

**zkao**: kayabaNerve:  you think this should not be a general community update, just an update for the technical community?

**lederstrumpf**: I think while we're in the specification stage, the community updates will be very technical in nature, so I'd say this still makes sense as a general update

**kayabaNerve**: zkao: Other way around. I think yoiu got too technical. I want to make the disclaimer the third paragraph, prune the reasonings after, and put more of a smile on it

**kayabaNerve**: Which also means dropping some commentary on micro services and the zeromq reference.

**zkao**: ah, yes, zeromq, u were asking about it the other day: it abstract sockets in a way that it becomes easy to change from inter-process communication (working as a multithreading lib) to networking stuff

**kayabaNerve**:  Got that :)

**kayabaNerve**: Thanks

**zkao**: kayabaNerve: feel very welcome to implement the proposed changes

**TheCharlatan**: zkao did you do more research on lnp/bp?

**TheCharlatan**: I tried running it again, but their recent changes were confusing me and seemed to have brought their docs out of sync.

**zkao**: yep, same here

**TheCharlatan**: So I guess what I'm saying is, I failed, but I also did not try _that_ hard.

**TheCharlatan**: Anyway, to me it seems risky to build on their stuff.

**zkao**: less risky than building from scratch?

**zkao**: if their node doesnt work, we have a bunch of microservices that work

**zkao**: and we have to make the node work

**zkao**: we have to do that in any case

**kayabaNerve**: zkao: I would like to delete everything between the dashes for a less verbose, and slightly less technical per word, version I have introduced to the doc. My concern isn't how technical it is per word, but rather being overwhelming

**kayabaNerve**: I also moved up the clarification about what this means and removed the phrase expecting this to be controversial. It shouldn't be based on our discusssions

**kayabaNerve**: I also left in enough guts anyone technical gets the same message (AFAICT)

**kayabaNerve**: As for our work, I do think maturity will be the deciding factor in if we use LNP/BP

**zkao**: the thing is the current options are: do everything from scratch or LNP/BP

**kayabaNerve**: It does appear like it isn't stable enough to build on, and for that reason, not worth discussing (why would we use it, how would we...) outside of noting it for the future.

**zkao**: the other nodes are not so flexible

**TheCharlatan**: What flexibility characteristics are you looking for zkao?

**zkao**: build atomic swaps

**kayabaNerve**: I rather continue from scratch, especially since we don't need a whole P2P stack. Don't we expect integrating apps to provide such comms, whether its to a centralized server for OTC or a DEX's own net?

**kayabaNerve**: And we're not going from scratch; we have a communications layer for micro services

**kayabaNerve**: And are following standards when possible

**zkao**: our commitment to the community is to build maintainable code

**zkao**: i like the protocol level approach, composing protocols

**zkao**: u dont get that if u dont follow tons of standarts

**zkao**: u end up with a bunch of private networks, not with an internet

**TheCharlatan**: zkao , you say that other nodes are not so flexible, but in which way that is relevant to atomic swaps?

**zkao**: they're more monolithic

**lederstrumpf**: I think at this stage, the reasoning is primarily staying close to lightning to facilitate an easier integration in future.

That being said, building atop of LNP/BP will certainly bring an upfront cost that is significant, and must be weighed up against maintainability improvements, and whether a more intricate networking stack is justified by the needs of atomic swaps.

I'm personally also open to a barebones gRPC kinda networking, as suggested by kayabaNerve & TheCharlatan previously.

**zkao**: not easy to customize services

**zkao**: TheCharlatan: maybe u know something i dont

**zkao**: so please share

**zkao**: what node are u thinking of?

**zkao**: kayabaNerve: i agree that its not stable to build on. Did you go throught their code and docs?

**TheCharlatan**: Lets try this a bit more pragmatically. Lets do a test example. For the atomic swaps we need to watch transactions. Lets say I want you to provide me a transaction for spending condition 'x'. Can you do that in lnp/bp?

**zkao**: most likely not

**zkao**: but i can do that in javascript with the need of zero standards

**zkao**: (not true, but close)

**TheCharlatan**: :P

**zkao**: did u read their code and docs, TheCharlatan ?

**kayabaNerve**: Sorry for drifting out. Work thing came up

**kayabaNerve**: lederstrumpf: I asked about ZeroMQ alternatives to reduce weight. I didn't suggest anything

**kayabaNerve**: zkao: I looked at their docs briefly, and I appreciate it. I haven't done anything with it though, so I'm basing my view of stability after the update you were working on and other commentary here.

**zkao**: zmq is a freaking cool tech, why u want to drop it?

**zkao**: read the bible: https://zguide.zeromq.org/

**lederstrumpf**: kayabaNerve: ack - sorry I misremembered - should have checked

**kayabaNerve**: Because it's an entire networking stack going beyond async runtimes into multi channel pub sub/gossip. I really dislike bloat.

**kayabaNerve**: But I'm also not used to such libs. I'm used to either working with async sockets, and their raw bytes, or fully established ecosystems (Ethereum/JSON RPC/Bitcoin/whatever)

**kayabaNerve**: lederstrumpf: All good :)

**kayabaNerve**: So I'm out of my depth a bit here, hence why I asked about it.

**TheCharlatan**: zkao, I guess what I'm saying is that I read their docs, but I don't how to do even such a basic thing. As you said I do know how to do that though with a couple of lines of javascript and 1000+ dependencies...

**zkao**: to do ur simple thing u need rust-bitcoin

**zkao**: not LNP/BP

**zkao**: u r operating at another level of abstraction

**kayabaNerve**: I personally wouldn't mind using a JSON-RPC to talk to Electrum/bitcoind, rust-bitcoin to craft transactions, and whatever we decide to talk between microservices (0MQ + protobuf/cap'n'proto/json?), writing said services ourselves. I assumed we would :p

**lederstrumpf**: broadly, is there a benefit from a gossip layer for the fundamental swap protocol? Certainly needed for a DEX, and possibly useful for advanced syncer delegation, but don't yet see an upside for the fundamental protocol.

**TheCharlatan**: I actually don't think rust-bitcoin can do that either. It can just listen to gossip.

**TheCharlatan**: So I kinda agree with kayabaNerve here.

**kayabaNerve**: By rust-bitcoin, I just meant something to handle TX crafting/signing. The SegWit rules are annoying. I was not suggesting natively listening to BTC P2P traffic, though that would be fascinating to impl into Farcaster

**kayabaNerve**: lederstrumpf: I don't believe so. All our microservices should be agnostic until we get to our example app, which should be client-server IMO.

**zkao**: ok, guys, can you guys work on a community update explaining what you've been working on

**andytoshi**: rust-bitcoin can parse/serialize btc p2p messages, for hat it's worth

**andytoshi**: though i also use it mainly to create txes and send them over RPC

**kayabaNerve**: andytoshi: Yep

**kayabaNerve**: zkao: The notes on LNP/BP are still extremely valuable and something we should consider into the future. It just doesn't appear to be something we can build on now.

**zkao**: there is this assumption we will build on top of it

**zkao**: and its more like, we will take a lego box

**zkao**: and build stuff with it

**kayabaNerve**: Except if it's not stable enough to build with it...

**zkao**: or even more correctly, we will build small daemons, and get them to talk to each other through message buses

**kayabaNerve**: I do understand we're not discussing forking it, yet rather working with it.

**kayabaNerve**: It still requires stability

**zkao**: i was thinking we're forking it

**kayabaNerve**: Oh. Sorry, missed that.

**kayabaNerve**: And then everyomne here is suggesting small daemons ;) Q is if we can integrate LNP/BP at this time since it's one man team heavily in development and likely not currently viable to build an app around

**TheCharlatan**: zkao did you ask on their irc if they think if it is viable yet to build on it?

**zkao**: i didnt ask, but its not viable, i dont need to ask that, i looked at their code -- its all incomplete

**zkao**: but again, i feel h4sh3d and i weren't clear, but certainly we dont want to build on top of it

**zkao**: we want to fork it and customize it

**kayabaNerve**: What's their license?

**zkao**: ur favorite one :P

**lederstrumpf**: MIT

**kayabaNerve**: Nice

**kayabaNerve**: Then my argument becomes I don't want to inherit incomplete code we may not understand where it's incomplete/code that does so much when we need it for X

**kayabaNerve**: And while we can always PR back to master, I know we're not forgoing their future work, it still seems like a lot if we can't just call out to it

**kayabaNerve**: So now I'm coming from an intracacy complexity + bloat standpoint

**kayabaNerve**: But not, I don't think forking it was clear :p Let me know if I'm outnumbered. Happy to trust you guys.

**zkao**: i beg u, kayabaNerve, to have a careful look at their libraries and documentation

**lederstrumpf**: zkao, @ your earlier question: I'll integrate my work into the community update over the weekend - bunch of other work deadlines until Friday.

**kayabaNerve**: Will do either today/tomorrow. I have gone over their docs briefly

**lederstrumpf**: we've also reached end of our scheduled meeting

**kayabaNerve**: Not completely ignorant. Basing my opinions of their code off what I've seen here + personal history

**gingeropolous**: is there any utility in coordinating with the potentially new anon dev in monero that plans to rework monero's p2p ?

**TheCharlatan**: gingeropolous the swap's interaction with monero's p2p is pretty minimal (watch a single address with a shared view key), so I doubt there is much overlap.

**TheCharlatan**: besides, everbody in monero anyways uses the same rpc's at some stage, so there's no big discussion on having a unified protocol.

**TheCharlatan**: well, except mymonero, but that is another story.

**gingeropolous**: gotcha

**TheCharlatan**: however, h4sh3d did some monero serialization work that might have to be changed down the line, if they end up changing some serialization. They might be interested in continuing work on monero-rs https://github.com/monero-rs/monero-rs
