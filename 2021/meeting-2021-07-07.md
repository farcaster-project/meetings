`Jul 07 14:00:14 <h4sh3d>`	meeting start in any minutes

`Jul 07 14:00:16 <TheCharlatan>`	hello :)

`Jul 07 14:00:26 <h4sh3d>`	hello everyone

`Jul 07 14:02:27 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	hi

`Jul 07 14:02:38 <zkao>`	hey

`Jul 07 14:03:57 <h4sh3d>`	shall we start with a round table of last week work?!

`Jul 07 14:04:28 <TheCharlatan>`	yes, I'll start

`Jul 07 14:05:31 <TheCharlatan>`	spent some time reviewing and merging zkao's walletd pull request, but he will probably have more to say about this.

`Jul 07 14:06:19 <TheCharlatan>`	I spent the rest of my time over the last week wiring the syncer up to electurm, still working on that as of now.

`Jul 07 14:06:39 <zkao>`	nice

`Jul 07 14:07:24 <TheCharlatan>`	Mostly been doing research on how to architecture a nice notification event loop for the watch blocks and address subscriptions.

`Jul 07 14:07:45 <TheCharlatan>`	and that's it :)

`Jul 07 14:08:21 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	I'll go next then

`Jul 07 14:08:30 <h4sh3d>`	TheCharlatan: if you want to have access to electrum (electrs) server synced where you can tweak the config we have one for mainnet and testnet 

`Jul 07 14:08:37 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	unless there are comments

`Jul 07 14:09:10 <zkao>`	he's using a public node right now

`Jul 07 14:09:30 <zkao>`	yes, go ahead, lederstrumpf[m] 

`Jul 07 14:11:19 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	I extended the integration tests to launch two daemons and have the second accept an offer from the first: https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/pull/45

`Jul 07 14:12:17 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	testing the happy case works correctly and gracefully shuts down all services

`Jul 07 14:12:40 <zkao>`	nice, that is really needed

`Jul 07 14:13:31 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	the only problem is testing panic cases - the error is not passed up to the highest layer correctly and panics somewhere in the middle, so can't make assertions for these cases at the testing level, and also can't shut down gracefully.

`Jul 07 14:13:54 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	I haven't found where this occurs yet, but once that's fixed, we can test a variety of setups.

`Jul 07 14:15:09 <h4sh3d>`	when you say 'test panic cases' you mean testing known cases where it should panic?

`Jul 07 14:15:15 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	yes

`Jul 07 14:15:38 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	say, for incorrect magic bytes in the offer

`Jul 07 14:15:44 <h4sh3d>`	in my understanding we should not have panics in the code base

`Jul 07 14:16:19 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	incorrect magic bytes lead to panic

`Jul 07 14:16:26 <h4sh3d>`	ok, so in your example the goal is to return an error and test for that error with something like assert!(res.is_err())

`Jul 07 14:16:38 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	yup, exactly

`Jul 07 14:16:45 <h4sh3d>`	good

`Jul 07 14:17:20 <zkao>`	the binaries are not handling errors, just the internals

`Jul 07 14:17:56 <zkao>`	https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/tree/main/src/bin

`Jul 07 14:19:30 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	ah, right - of course these errors aren't being passed upstream, since they'd be crossing the boundary between distinct binaries.

`Jul 07 14:20:07 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	so that would require a deliberate API

`Jul 07 14:22:11 <zkao>`	why would u want to test incorrect magic bytes in the offer at this level?

`Jul 07 14:22:16 <h4sh3d>`	the test I described above is not a integration test, it should be at the library level (either in node or core)

`Jul 07 14:22:23 <zkao>`	that should be a unit test, no?

`Jul 07 14:22:31 <h4sh3d>`	yes, I think too

`Jul 07 14:22:46 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	you're right, that does make more sense as a unit test.

`Jul 07 14:23:16 <h4sh3d>`	but we still want to see what happen if we feed the binary with this kind of value too, no?!

`Jul 07 14:23:52 <zkao>`	crashing typically makes it easier, not harder, to understand where bugs are

`Jul 07 14:24:12 <zkao>`	vs propagating errors, specially if they crash only at the surface

`Jul 07 14:25:06 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	well, a propagated error should be tagged to easily identify the source

`Jul 07 14:25:38 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	I'll have a good think about this and see what's the best balance of expressive testing and minimising injecting test suite clutter into the codebase.

`Jul 07 14:26:05 <zkao>`	use integration tests for integration tests

`Jul 07 14:26:33 <zkao>`	u can look at the moon with a microscope, and it wont be too useful

`Jul 07 14:27:52 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	yeah, but integration tests are also about testing how the parts interact once one of them malfunctions.

`Jul 07 14:28:05 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	to get an idea of collateral damage

`Jul 07 14:28:16 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	anyway - that's it from my side

`Jul 07 14:28:23 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	thanks for the input!

`Jul 07 14:28:56 <zkao>`	so i discussed a bit with the very fine folks from zeromq

`Jul 07 14:29:10 <zkao>`	and they suggested to try to make the broker as stateless as possible

`Jul 07 14:30:16 <zkao>`	so i m gearing farcasterd to have less state

`Jul 07 14:31:37 <zkao>`	that would mean, for example, swapd(swap_id) sends a message to walletd (through the broker farcaster), but farcasterd does no validation nor nothing

`Jul 07 14:31:41 <zkao>`	just routes

`Jul 07 14:32:11 <zkao>`	otherwise you have to pass state on the requests themselves

`Jul 07 14:33:06 <zkao>`	this is work for the next weeks

`Jul 07 14:33:09 <h4sh3d>`	does swapd(...) knows which one wallted (if many) to target, or does that job is done by farcasterd (I think I know the answer based on what you said :p)

`Jul 07 14:33:23 <zkao>`	it must know

`Jul 07 14:33:40 <zkao>`	because the way we address using internet2

`Jul 07 14:34:07 <zkao>`	in practice, at the code level, walletd sends a msg to swapd

`Jul 07 14:34:17 <zkao>`	but in reality, it gets routed though farcasterd

`Jul 07 14:34:55 <h4sh3d>`	other question, what is the current sequence of binaries launch?

`Jul 07 14:36:35 <zkao>`	i let TheCharlatan respond, he was looking into this recently

`Jul 07 14:37:08 <zkao>`	i'd guess f -> w -> p -> sw

`Jul 07 14:37:14 <TheCharlatan>`	farcasterd is launched first, it launches walletd. then peerd and swapd are launched as needed.

`Jul 07 14:37:35 <TheCharlatan>`	syncerd is not integrated yet.

`Jul 07 14:38:14 <zkao>`	so this past week I moved a bunch of functionality from farcasterd to walletd

`Jul 07 14:38:26 <zkao>`	including alice and bob structures

`Jul 07 14:39:43 <h4sh3d>`	1 farcasterd and 1 walletd in the system, then 1 swapd per swap and peerds per connection

`Jul 07 14:39:59 <TheCharlatan>`	yes

`Jul 07 14:40:35 <h4sh3d>`	what was discussed about syncers per swap?

`Jul 07 14:40:48 <h4sh3d>`	syncers are shared like walletd

`Jul 07 14:41:04 <h4sh3d>`	just 1 per chain (e.g. 1 btc and 1 xmr)

`Jul 07 14:41:07 <zkao>`	yes

`Jul 07 14:41:19 <zkao>`	thats what we said

`Jul 07 14:41:38 <h4sh3d>`	(that's what SHE said ;p)

Jul 07 14:41:51 *	gingeropolous has quit (Quit: ZNC 1.6.3+deb1ubuntu0.2 - http://znc.in)

`Jul 07 14:42:02 <zkao>`	but we havent tried too hard yet, so maybe we'll find it limiting

`Jul 07 14:42:55 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	h4sh3d: your joke chased away gingeropolous :P

`Jul 07 14:43:23 <zkao>`	no clue what u guys are talking about

`Jul 07 14:43:25 <h4sh3d>`	oh no :(

`Jul 07 14:43:42 <h4sh3d>`	https://media1.tenor.com/images/9867b1fa3ac337972f761e313a177609/tenor.gif?itemid=4084628

`Jul 07 14:44:01 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	I can't (yet) imagine that having one shared syncer per chain would be a bottleneck.

`Jul 07 14:45:15 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	as in: I'm sure that limit is only hit after we've already well saturated a single farcasterd.

`Jul 07 14:45:33 <h4sh3d>`	I think so

`Jul 07 14:45:35 <zkao>`	we didnt mean it as a bottle neck

`Jul 07 14:46:11 <zkao>`	anyway, we havent built it fully

`Jul 07 14:46:12 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	haha, I don't think any software project plans them ;)

`Jul 07 14:46:15 <zkao>`	so we dont know if it works

`Jul 07 14:46:29 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	let's move on

`Jul 07 14:46:38 <zkao>`	im done

`Jul 07 14:46:52 <h4sh3d>`	I worked with TheCharlatan to merge some PRs that were waiting on core

`Jul 07 14:47:27 <h4sh3d>`	mainly the refactoring and the work from kayabaNerve and TheCharlatan on primitives for the syncers

`Jul 07 14:47:55 <h4sh3d>`	the main branch on core is now with all these changes, but miss proper encoding/strict encoding support

`Jul 07 14:48:42 <h4sh3d>`	so my job now is to re-add those in a slightly better way (because of the refactor), and then PR on the node to add those changes

`Jul 07 14:49:33 <h4sh3d>`	the refactor also changed quit heavily the 'wallet' stuff that was in core, so for that part I'll see how it goes and discuss with you on the node's PR

`Jul 07 14:49:46 <h4sh3d>`	that's mostly it for me

`Jul 07 14:49:59 <h4sh3d>`	*that's it for me

`Jul 07 14:51:57 <lederstrumpf[m]>`	I have to bounce - cheers

`Jul 07 14:52:07 <h4sh3d>`	bye

`Jul 07 14:52:23 <h4sh3d>`	anything else we need to discuss?

`Jul 07 14:53:55 <zkao>`	yes, any recommendation on the node work while your working on integrating the new core?

`Jul 07 14:54:21 <h4sh3d>`	TheCharlatan: I though a month ago that if we design the syncer so we can 'simulate' the blockchain, we can maybe use them in our integration tests

`Jul 07 14:54:19 <zkao>`	shall we work normally, or shall we avoid some bits?

`Jul 07 14:54:41 <h4sh3d>`	work normally, no need to avoid stuff

`Jul 07 14:55:23 <TheCharlatan>`	yeah, I think that is totally reasonable. We can 'pre-record' some events that we then send to the syncer.

`Jul 07 14:55:36 <h4sh3d>`	I think it'll be pretty straight forward to port the changes in the node

`Jul 07 14:57:09 <h4sh3d>`	yes something like that, and I think it is particularly good to be able to simulate reorgs or other stuff that are hard to get on-chain at the right timing, but can happen in real life 1 in a 100(0) swaps

`Jul 07 14:57:48 <zkao>`	ok, cheers guys

`Jul 07 14:58:30 <h4sh3d>`	alright, I think we can adjourn here

`Jul 07 14:58:36 <h4sh3d>`	thanks for attending
