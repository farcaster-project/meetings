Nov 24 13:57:48 <h4sh3d>	meeting this afternoon normally!
Nov 24 14:08:35 <TheCharlatan>	so, now?
Nov 24 14:13:40 <h4sh3d>	Who's arround?
Nov 24 14:12:47 *	zkao sips his coffee on an attempt to wake up
Nov 24 14:15:00 <TheCharlatan>	since you reminded us of the meeting h4sh3d, what do you want to talk about?
Nov 24 14:17:22 <h4sh3d>	hah
Nov 24 14:17:43 <h4sh3d>	when opening #230 yesterday
Nov 24 14:17:58 <h4sh3d>	I though about just modify some little arguments in the command line
Nov 24 14:18:26 <h4sh3d>	but now, to make it better and more correct, I'm in a rabbit hole for managing arguments and config file
Nov 24 14:18:27 <h4sh3d>	:)
Nov 24 14:19:03 <h4sh3d>	so currently I'm working on how the bins take their args and load their config
Nov 24 14:19:55 <h4sh3d>	The idea is to have a file (e.g. farcaster.toml), somewhere, that contains config such as the syncers server url, or any other stuff microservice need to know
Nov 24 14:20:12 <h4sh3d>	and stuff that is not passed in arguments at launch
Nov 24 14:20:36 <h4sh3d>	the file is loaded with the flag -c when launching a service
Nov 24 14:21:09 <h4sh3d>	my current issue is the Config struct in node is created based on arguments
Nov 24 14:21:39 <h4sh3d>	and this is used in part of the code I wouldn't touch hopefully
Nov 24 14:22:11 <h4sh3d>	so I'm finding a good way to make it work without touching the service.rs file
Nov 24 14:22:24 <h4sh3d>	that's it
Nov 24 14:23:18 <h4sh3d>	otherwise I did multiple swap over the network with different computers, its running really good and stable (the network stack)
Nov 24 14:23:44 <h4sh3d>	what about you TheCharlatan?
Nov 24 14:25:25 <TheCharlatan>	I've mostly been working on the functional test and testing PR's. There's still a lot of weird syncer behavior that I am trying to bisect, but I feel like a lot of it is the syncer polling too often.
Nov 24 14:26:17 <TheCharlatan>	h4sh3d will we still be able to pass all the arguments directly to farcaster-node after your #230?
Nov 24 14:26:35 <zkao>	h4sh3d: cool that you tested, TheCharlatan, is there is some interference  btw swaps when connecting to the same wallet rpc
Nov 24 14:26:37 <zkao>	?
Nov 24 14:26:50 <TheCharlatan>	Would be nice if it could generate the config file from the args if no file is given yet.
Nov 24 14:27:45 <TheCharlatan>	zkao multiple swaps should not be a problem, multiple syncers using the same wallet-rpc definitely is a problem.
Nov 24 14:27:57 <zkao>	h4sh3d: can u specify the priority sequence, between passing the argument, reading the $FARCASTER_ terminal values, and the config toml?
Nov 24 14:30:08 <h4sh3d>	argument and $FARCASTER_ env values are managed by clap (don't know who take over the other, but I guess arg > env)
Nov 24 14:31:06 <h4sh3d>	and config is in toml (different that what in args), if no toml we load default values (like we do in args), with toml file we override the defaults
Nov 24 14:31:30 <h4sh3d>	and for know the only thing that move from the args to the config file is the syncers urls
Nov 24 14:32:17 <h4sh3d>	so without -c default URLs are loaded, with -c we override with what's inside the config file
Nov 24 14:32:26 <h4sh3d>	that's the idea, what do you think?
Nov 24 14:31:32 <TheCharlatan>	so you will only be able to specify the url's by the config file?
Nov 24 14:31:47 <zkao>	yesterday i was a bit stressed, and not sure i expressed myself correctly on my communication in github regarding this stuff
Nov 24 14:32:03 <zkao>	so i guess lets try to sort out it works for everybody's work flow
Nov 24 14:33:14 <h4sh3d>	TheCharlatan: yes, that was the idae
Nov 24 14:33:17 <h4sh3d>	*idea
Nov 24 14:34:00 <h4sh3d>	If I take a step back:
Nov 24 14:35:04 <h4sh3d>	the config file can from this thought: if we control only with args, syncer will receive its urls with args, but because it is started by farcasterd
Nov 24 14:36:01 <h4sh3d>	either we have to pass all syncers args when starting fcd (what we do currently), or syncer has another source to get the config: a config file (shared by all services, but that can change)
Nov 24 14:36:13 <h4sh3d>	that was my thinking
Nov 24 14:35:37 <zkao>	but farcasterd would read this config file?
Nov 24 14:38:02 <h4sh3d>	if we need yes, if we want to put config related to fcd yes
Nov 24 14:39:26 <h4sh3d>	for now I'm not sure what fcd need that is not needed by others
Nov 24 14:40:07 <h4sh3d>	but because we launch fcd and swap-cli by hand it is easy to put everything in command line arguments
Nov 24 14:41:09 <h4sh3d>	when I say specific I think of: syncer coin+network+urls, wallet coin?+network+?
Nov 24 14:40:05 <zkao>	TheCharlatan: are you online?
Nov 24 14:41:40 <h4sh3d>	and peerd already has some arg for listening of connecting
Nov 24 14:41:56 <h4sh3d>	but its working and not related to swaps
Nov 24 14:40:54 <TheCharlatan>	> so without -c default URLs are loaded, with -c we override with what's inside the config file
Nov 24 14:41:05 <TheCharlatan>	so args will remain and will overwrite values in the config file?
Nov 24 14:42:17 <h4sh3d>	no
Nov 24 14:41:16 <zkao>	who takes the -c parameter?
Nov 24 14:41:21 <zkao>	its a share one?
Nov 24 14:42:31 <h4sh3d>	for now yes
Nov 24 14:41:35 <zkao>	ok, now i get it
Nov 24 14:41:48 <zkao>	can u point to some code, that PR is noisy
Nov 24 14:43:22 <h4sh3d>	yes it is, lemme try to point to some code that is relevant (its heavily WIP on my side too)
Nov 24 14:43:03 <TheCharlatan>	h4sh3d can you explain what you mean in the line I quoted again?
Nov 24 14:43:20 <TheCharlatan>	Also, I'll be afk now, see you soon!
Nov 24 14:44:43 <h4sh3d>	this https://github.com/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/pull/230/files#diff-cba64c21ab992eaad29fce147a08f4560a4769bc14682b8a96081a5fd02dbecd
Nov 24 14:45:25 <h4sh3d>	parse_config function, takes the -c arg value, a path to the config file
Nov 24 14:45:50 <h4sh3d>	parse it and try to return a Config struct
Nov 24 14:46:43 <h4sh3d>	TheCharlatan: the cmd line arg are separated from the config "arg"
Nov 24 14:47:05 <h4sh3d>	urls will not be managed by cmd arg but only with the file
Nov 24 14:47:39 <h4sh3d>	in cmd arg you use the value -c to point to a file or not, if not we load the default config
Nov 24 14:47:58 <h4sh3d>	config = src/config.rs "Config" struct in that case
Nov 24 14:48:20 <h4sh3d>	let me push my latest WIP on that branch, the concept is the same
Nov 24 14:47:45 <zkao>	the issue is that there are 2 levels of config that are compatible, and a third one overlayed that overwrites everything
Nov 24 14:48:01 <zkao>	one with the shell variables and the command lines arguments
Nov 24 14:48:28 <zkao>	these two are from clap and are compatible, the inherited ones
Nov 24 14:48:52 <zkao>	and the third one, at a classical h4sh3d, overwrites all the rest lol
Nov 24 14:53:05 <zkao>	the situation i want to avoid in farcasterd is to be forced to pass too many args if we're running swaps that requires say >3 different syncers
Nov 24 14:54:12 <zkao>	whats the view on syncer in general?
Nov 24 14:54:20 <zkao>	is it ok for farcasterd to launch them?
Nov 24 14:58:21 <h4sh3d>	I think yes, fcd should manage the pool of syncers
